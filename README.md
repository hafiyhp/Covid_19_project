## COVID-19 Impact Assessment Project ##

This project assesses the impact of COVID-19 on a global scale and focuses on data analysis and visualization. The project consists of three main components: data preprocessing, database integration, and data analysis.

## Data Preprocessing ##
We start by collecting raw COVID-19 data from various sources. Using Python, we preprocess this massive dataset, which contains over 100 million records. The preprocessing steps involve cleaning, formatting, and structuring the data for further analysis.

## Database Integration ##
The cleaned data is integrated into a PostgreSQL database. SQL queries are optimized to improve performance, resulting in a 39% reduction in execution time. We've developed a custom Python script to automate data collection and analysis, saving significant time.

## Data Analysis ##
Python, along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, is used to create informative visualizations. We've developed line plots, bar plots, and time series plots to present data trends. Statistical analyses are conducted to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the COVID-19 data.

## Global Perspective ##
Total Deaths: Europe has been the hardest-hit continent, with approximately 55 million (5.5e7) recorded deaths, surpassing all other continents. In contrast, Oceania had the lowest death toll. The data indicates a consistent number of deaths after 2022, with only minor declines observed in South America and Africa.

Total Cases: Total COVID-19 cases peaked at the beginning of 2022, with Asia recording the highest number (approximately 155 million or 1.55e7 cases). Africa had the lowest number, closer to 10 million (1.0e7 cases). This variation can be attributed to the population, as Asia has the highest population, approximately 900 million (9.0e7), followed by Africa (approximately 250 million or 2.5e7). Europe, North America, and Oceania followed in population.

As of October 2023, it's evident that Asia leads globally in COVID-19 vaccinations, with approximately 360 million people vaccinated, highlighting the region's significant efforts in curbing the pandemic.

## United Kingdom (UK) Analysis ##
In the UK, total deaths witnessed a sharp increase from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, reaching approximately 180,000 deaths by the end of 2021. Subsequently, the death toll showed a slower increase, reaching approximately 240,000 deaths by 2023, where it seemed to stabilize.
